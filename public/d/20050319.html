<!--Should give the date I posted this.  I love being lazy.-->
<br><u><i>Saturday , March 19 , 2005:  It isn't supposed to be anybody, really.</i></u><br>
</center>
<!--Now for some comments.-->

<p>Spring Break's been fun (I hesitate to say 'so far' because I really only have Sunday left before school starts).  I didn't get as much work done as I hoped--that is, draw assloads of comics and apply for bunches of scholarships.  I did finish that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0072434228/qid=1111262245/sr=8-4/ref=pd_csp_4/002-4562050-5502420?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">book</a>, though.  It was okay.  It wasn't <i>bad</i> writing or anything, but nothing stood out as particularly interesting or cool.  The only thing that made it different than something you'd buy at <a href="http://www.carrsqc.com/">Carrs</a> is the fact that it's written by a black lady about black people that lived around other black people. Ooh, wow!  Geez.  No offense, Mrs. Bills (my English teacher).</p>

<p>So, in this comic... this has actually happened to me. Not exactly like that, though--that's really a conglomeration of two different instances.  The first happened at that location exactly, while the other had my friend Jake yell, "Hey!  Get back to work!", or something of the sort.  Of course, in neither instance was I drawing a boat.</p>

<p>Something people ask me--and this will likely be the first question that goes up on my FAQs if I ever compose a set--is, "Is that supposed to be somebody?", or "Is that {fill IN that blank!}?".  Usually, the answer's no.  In this comic, for example, the only person that <i>is</i> somebody is me.  The rest of the characters aren't anybody in particular (though the red-haired child is loosely based off of Jake).  I couldn't remember who exactly was there and I'm usually really bad at trying to draw recognizable versions of other people, so I didn't even bother.  So, unless I either say so or draw a representation of me, the person depicted probably isn't supposed to be somebody in real life.<p>

<p>The other thing you might find interesting is that this gives a pretty good view of how I draw a lot of these--really all of them so far, though I honestly do have ones originally drawn in ink. That gray thing is my <a href="http://www.wacom.com/productinfo/6x8.cfm">Wacom tablet</a>.  On the screen you see Photoshop 6  (Elements 2 sucks by the way--they took away antialiasing, as far as I can tell).  These two fine products together bring you what you've been seeing so far.  I like drawing with the tablet, though it took a few hours to get used to it.  It's not something where you can instantly draw as well as you can on paper, for different reasons, but once you get the hang of it...</p>

<p>My brother bought <a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/products/swkotor/">KOTOR</a> last Monday.  It was fairly cheap because KOTOR II is out now.  It is still a damned good game!  I haven't even played it, but I wasted all--and I <b>mean</b> all--of Wednesday just watching my brother play it.  I can't wait 'till he lets me play it myself.  (Actually I can, but...)  Anyhow, yes, very good game.  Like, as in, "holy crap".</p>

<p>Oh...Thursday was Saint Patrick's Day.  I didn't wear green.  Neither did my younger brother.  I have a feeling my younger sister didn't even know it was Saint Patrick's Day.  Mua-ha-ha!  I bring this up, though, because I found this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Chicago_River_dyed_green%2C_focus_on_river.jpg">really cool picture</a> of a Saint Partick's Day celebration in Chicago on Wikipedia.  It's my wallpaper right now.

<p>I got a Gmail account.  I could have gotten an invite ages ago, but only now, when Google started offering them to the general public, did I decide to get one.  It's probably because I decided that I'm not going to get anything worthy from colleges... or something.  I dunno.  I'm checking both of them now.  Oh, well.  The Gmail account seems nice.  I like that I <i>start</i> at my inbox instead of some other shitty screen that doesn't matter and the fact that I don't have to load another page to reply is pretty cool too.</p>

<p>Finally, I updated both the links page and the email page.  In email, I just changed it to show my new email address, obviously.  In links, I changed some things around to better reflect what I'm reading and added a banner for my own comic.  Yaay!  Go check it out!  If you don't know why there aren't any faces on it, consider the fact that almost <i>all</i> banners for webcomics have the faces of their characters plastered on the front of it.  You don't get that none, no sah!  I give you something <b>bold</b>! And F4C3-free!</p>

<p>So, until next week, where I update just as well as I did here,</p>

<p>--Josh</p>

<!--Okay, what's going on here is that I want to have a row of nav buttons
between my comic and comments.  However, based on what I can find in the 
Keenspace Gear thing, there really isn't a way to separate these things.
Luckily, comments support HTML.  Hopefully, they'll support keentags, too.
I bet you they do.  So the second row's going in there, too.  Ha!
