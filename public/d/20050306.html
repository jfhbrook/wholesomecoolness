<!--Now for some comments.-->

<p>Yes, I am back from Academic Decathlon.  We did pretty well, though not quite as awesome as last year (third, not second in our division).  Also, West Valley still kicked our asses hard.  I personally got a bronze in economics and a silver in essay (and I was in the honors category).  I also got an alternate slot for the UAF half-tuition scholarship (Heidi Hartley, also from our school, got the main slot in my category, and I'm happy for her--she needs some scholarships.  Way to go Heidi, as dorky as that reads.  Anyhow, now I'm kinda tired, and I have homeworks to do, so I think I'll try to keep it short.</p>

<p>I liked the idea of a gaming dryad as soon as I thought of it about six months ago.  I didn't have the skill to draw it to my satisfaction at the time, though.  Now I'm better.  Anyhow, this one isn't quite as funny I hear as my last one, but I still think this one's cool.</p>

<p>Oh!  One last thing--I got my free PS2 running.  My friend Dylan gave it to me when it stopped working and his dad got him a new one.  He lost all the cords, though.  Anyhow, it was just dust collected on the lens, and I bought all the stuff I needed in town.  The AV cord was ten dollars and the controller I bought used for 3 bucks--just needed some scrubbing to remove the old kool-aid.  So, a functional PS2 for $15 = good deal. :D</p>

<p>--Josh</p>

<p>P.S. The FTP setup to Keenspace <a href="http://forums.keenspace.com/viewtopic.php?t=63597&sid=3e5096e348a0c28d86ec5a3dfff63582">died sometime when I was gone,</a> and has been dead the whole day <a href="http://forums.keenspace.com/viewtopic.php?t=63595&sid=ea0f246cbccaf092c45a3b3f76f568a4">and then some</a>.  Therefore the comic's late by even more than I expected.</p>

<!--Okay, what's going on here is that I want to have a row of nav buttons
between my comic and comments.  However, based on what I can find in the 
Keenspace Gear thing, there really isn't a way to separate these things.
Luckily, comments support HTML.  Hopefully, they'll support keentags, too.
I bet you they do.  So the second row's going in there, too.  Ha!
