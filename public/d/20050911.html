<br><u><i>Sunday , September 11 , 2005: TITLE OF THIS RANT </i></u><br>

<!--Now for some comments.-->

<p>If there ever was a comic I drew that didn't. have. a. god. damned. punchline., this was it.  I think the general premise was a good idea, but this one just came out soo bad... I showed it to Jake, basically the only friend who will give me an honest and even assholish opinion, and he was all like, "uh...hah?  I dunno.  Am I supposed to laugh or something?  Where's the joke?"  Nate, on the other hand, "lmaoh"'d.  He thought it was the funniest thing ever.  I drew this waay back in February, as I suppose yee can tell.</p>

<p>I think this would have been better as a single-panel cartoon, a la that-really-well-known-single-panel-cartoon-that-single-panel-authors-hate-to-be-compared-to.  Like, it'd have this guy coming out back in time with his jacket, and the caption would be all like, "Murray, after finding out that aluminum was worth more than gold in the 1800's, fashioned himself a tuxedo out of coke cans and TELEPORTED HIMSELF BACK IN TIME!!!"  I think that'd be better.</p>

<p>Nah... I still don't think it works.</p>

<!--Okay, what's going on here is that I want to have a row of nav buttons
between my comic and comments.  However, based on what I can find in the 
Keenspace Gear thing, there really isn't a way to separate these things.
Luckily, comments support HTML.  Hopefully, they'll support keentags, too.
I bet you they do.  So the second row's going in there, too.  Ha!
