<br><u><i>Sunday , May 29 , 2005:  That's IT! <b>MEGA POWER!</b></i></u><br>
</center>
<!--Now for some comments.-->

<p>Chris is here tonight (Friday).  He hadn't gotten me his pictures for this senior slideshow, and we kinda used it as an excuse for him to spend the night.  This is the first time he's been at my house. (interject by Chris) Yeah his house is huge!!</p>

<p>Why I keep that there I don't know.</p>

<P>The name of the villian in this comic, Voltograb, was his idea.  I couldn't think of any good cheezy villian names and he was on MSN, so... Yeah, Chris gets recognition for that. The lightning bolt was totally my idea though. :D</p>

<p>I thought this about the Power Rangers at pretty much about the time I started to outgrow it... sorta.  Actually, I knew since forever that the Power Rangers were dumb.  Strangely, it took me a while to figure that out about Barney.  Later, I figured out that the Power Rangers were soo cheezy that they were awesome.  Only the original series though!!!  The later ones just sucked all-around.  Shit, even the older ones where they introduced green and white rangers were dumb.</p>

<p>I say we stick to the olde-timey plot:  Rita what's-her-face makes a new villian (with a giant easy-bake oven my friends tell me) to kick the crap out of the rangers; The bad guy and a bunch of gray dudes wreak havoc upon the metropolis; Zordon/that retarded robot thing go like, "Rangers!!1"; The rangers kick the crap out of the gray dudes and quintuple-team the main baddie; Rita What-the-crap gets all pissed off and throws her staff to Earth, which makes the bad guy get really big; The rangers get their megazord all put together (I'm pretty sure they eventually figured out that regular zords never worked); beat the ever-living shit out of the bad guy, unlocking a new power in the process.  This was the way to go dammit.</p>

<p>I swear to God I saw this episode:  Okay, so the megazord actually gets <i>kicked over</i>.  All looks lost, and the rangers are looking kinda rough.  The yellow (or possibly pink) ranger says, "Oh no!  If only we had <i><b>more power!!</b></i>".  "That's IT--<b>MEGA POWER!!!</b>, the red ranger exclaims, as he presses a new button.  The megazord comes back up without actually moving anything--like a board.  It does not move its hands, arms, or even feet.  A cheezy powering-up effect can be heard.  The megazord does a good ol' fashioned one-two and the baddie explodes wildly.</p>

<p>I am NOT making this up.  I swear to freaking God.</p>

<p>Early this week, some pretty interesting stuff happened in the world of webcomics for those who read this because they're my Mom or something.  First, a cool group of dudes left <a href="http://www.keenspot.com/">Keenspot</a> (not to be confused with Keenspace, my related web-space provider) to form their own group, <a href="http://www.blanklabelcomics.com/">Blank Label Comics</a>.  Some see this as an opportunity to bad-mouth Keenspot (which has its own share of problems, mostly with its revenue model as far as I can tell), but most seem to see it as, "Hey cool!  These guys are good enough that they outgrew Keenspot!  Rock on and good luck to them!".  I have only read a little of <a href="http://www.checkerboardnightmare.com">Kristopher</a> <a href="http://www.starshiftcrisis.com/">Straub's</a> work, but at least he's pretty good. :)  Lessee, also, some pretty serious shit going on at Keen<i>space</i>, with one of two main admins <a href="http://forums.keenspace.com/viewtopic.php?t=65473"leaving temporarily</a>, and there are also rumors of Keenspace going through a name-change.  I haven't been on Keenspace that long, but I do know that Kelly Price has done a lot of hard work with our servers, and I hope that Keen gets its shit straight. As far as the name change, I think it's to lessen confusion between the two names and not to keep Keenspot's soiled reputation separate or anything.  Still, this all makes me kinda nervous, though, like I should be teaching myself PHP so I can write scripts for my own web page hosted elsewhere...though I don't think Keenspace as a hosting service will go away anytime soon, so...</p>

<p>So, today (Friday) was my last required day of school. Pretty crazy!  Part of me still expects to have to take classes Tuesday morning.  I <i>do</i> have to go back though.  Man, school's NEVER gonna end! :)</p>

<p>Also, graduation's Thursday.  Look for a <b>BONUS COMIC</b> then!!!</p>

<p>This all also means that Senior Seminar as a class is over.  I got a B for the quarter.  I was bummed.  Actually, for a few minutes after I saw, "livid" would make a better descriptor of my mood.  I really shouldn't let this shit get to me, but oh, well. The POINT, though--I'm free.  So, what does this mean as far as content?  (Doesn't THIS sound familiar?)  <i>You'll</i> see... >:D.</p>

<p>You know, I'm actually pretty sure that's all I have to say.  Plus, Chris got so bored with me typing here he started hanging out with my brother.  Ha-ha!  So I'd better entertain him.</p>

<p>[edit] Sorry about the lack of comic.  I'm not sure what happened.  I really should double-check more often.[/edit]</p>

<!--Okay, what's going on here is that I want to have a row of nav buttons
between my comic and comments.  However, based on what I can find in the 
Keenspace Gear thing, there really isn't a way to separate these things.
Luckily, comments support HTML.  Hopefully, they'll support keentags, too.
I bet you they do.  So the second row's going in there, too.  Ha!
