<br><u><i>Thursday, February 28, 2008: BONUS COMIC</i></u><br>

<!--Now for some comments.-->

<p><em>This commentary was written in December 2024.</em></p>

<p>...So you thought the prior comic was the last one, right? Well, originally it was! For some context, <a href="/">check out the foreword</a>. Ok, done? Right.</p>

<p>So the truth is that, after I did my original run of Official Comics, I kept drawing and making comics for a number of years - I just didn't upload them to Comic Genesis is all. Instead, I posted them on Flickr. Remember Flickr?</p>

<p>You can see I wasn't doing digital comics by this point in 2008. Instead, I was using colored markers for everything. I had some difficulty controlling stroke width, but I think the comics I drew from this era otherwise looked really good.</p>

<p>But also, I think this comic is the single best visual gag I ever wrote. I could be wrong about that - I seem to recall that people I showed this to didn't really get it. But personally, I think it's great.</p>

<!--Okay, what's going on here is that I want to have a row of nav buttons
between my comic and comments.  However, based on what I can find in the 
Keenspace Gear thing, there really isn't a way to separate these things.
Luckily, comments support HTML.  Hopefully, they'll support keentags, too.
I bet you they do.  So the second row's going in there, too.  Ha!
