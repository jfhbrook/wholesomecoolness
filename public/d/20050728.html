<!--Now for some comments.-->

<p>Wow... so I'm back from Science Camp.  There isn't much to say, except:</p>

<center><p><font color=red>WOO!  I <3 SCIENCE CAMP!!!</font></p></center>

<p>Anyhow, so that's that. Oh, I also got some goodies, both at camp and after I got home.  I got an assload of Mardi Gras beads from Devin (he's from New Orleans), "Understanding Comics" from Ma and Pa, case lights from my bro-bro, a couple music CD's and some Escher stuff.  That, and a few bumper stickers and t-shirts.  Also, about a hundred new friends. :P</p>

<p>Pretty soon, I'm gonna start drawing again.  It will be nice.  I even have some ideas in mind...well, okay, one, but whatever.</p>

<p>Las Vegas was also pretty neat, but I preferred the Grand Canyon and Laughlin.  Las Vegas is just so... commercial, you know?  It's phony in a Holden Caulfield sort of way.</p>

<p>I'll probably have more to say this weekend, but for now I'll just finish with what I originally wrote:</p>

<p>I still like this page.  Some of them bother me, but this one's still pretty nifty I think.  I like the circle of frames.  The only bothersome thing is the red around the text at the bottom.</p>

<p>And how bout that choice of font?  Silkscreen is pretty common for sprite comics, but... I dunno.  It works.  What do you think?</p>

<p>--Joshy-Josh*</p>

<p><font size=1>* A silly nickname I received at camp.  Which reminds me of people that try to give themselves nicknames... but I would never do such a thing.  The funny thing is that at least four people have come up with "Joshy" as a nickname completely independently of each other.  I think it's gonna stick. :P</font></p>

<!--Okay, what's going on here is that I want to have a row of nav buttons
between my comic and comments.  However, based on what I can find in the 
Keenspace Gear thing, there really isn't a way to separate these things.
Luckily, comments support HTML.  Hopefully, they'll support keentags, too.
I bet you they do.  So the second row's going in there, too.  Ha!
