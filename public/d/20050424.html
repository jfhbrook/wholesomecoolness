<br><u><i>Sunday , April 24 , 2005: Graduation, such an aggravation! (to the tune of "Motivation" by Sum-41")</i></u><br>

<!--Now for some comments.-->

<p>Man, I'm tired.  My new tablet pen arrived in the mail two days after we ordered it, and I've pretty much been drawing since.  I can't tell <i>what</i> (I gotta keep it a secret for <i>someone</i>), but it's been fun anyway.  I'm so glad I have my new pen.</p>

<p>Still, this one was finished right before I got my pen, so it's in ink.  It'll be the last one for a while, and I actually don't think I'll really miss it.  Electronic art kicks five times the ass. :)  Anyhow... Tyler think I should really look into changing my name to this.  Meanwhile, my brother thinks I should have made it "Joshua F**kin' Holbrook" instead. :D  I myself prefer my real middle name.</p>

<p>It's "Ford", by the way.  Like the truck or the action star, either way.  My parents meant the latter, but then again the former also opens things up to "Why didn't you name him "Chevy/Dodge/etc.?", so... still doesn't change the spelling or pronunciation.</p>

<p>We had a student government meeting the other day.  Those suck balls.  In ninth and tenth grade you don't have to give a shit because it's all about fundraising.  In senior year, however, it all matters--graduation ceremony/class trip, all that.  And <i>nobody effing agrees on <b>anything</b>!</i>.  Christ, we had a vote to decide that we would stop at a mall and blow some of our money off and today Evan gets all pissy and thinks that because there's a significant minority (NOTE the use of the word MINORITY--because it was most definitely a majority vote) that doesn't want to go that the vote doesn't even matter.  I argue that the majority matters because... they're the FSCKING MAJORITY, but Evan wouldn't hear a word of it.  If I <i>really</i> wanted to go to the mall and blow money off on stuff but got outvoted, I would be irritated sure, but I <i>wouldn't</i> claim that it's unfair nor would I bitch about it and make a stink.  Okay, I <i>did</i> support having a revote on having our class advisor <i>as</i> our guest speaker, but that was because I felt that kids didn't get enough time to think of better speakers and because our advisor was RIGHT THERE.  I'm not horribly upset that he did become our speaker, but I think with some time we could have done better.  Meanwhile, we <i>had</i> FOUR friggin' days to think about this class trip thing, not five minutes.  Big god-damned difference, people.</p>

<p>Okay, bad rant one.</p>

<p>Second:  Has anybody been reading at wigu.com recently?  He friggin' changed it back to Wigu!  Okay, so I <i>liked</i> Wigu, and I'm glad he's back I guess, but I'm sick of all these switcheroos.  First he's all like, "I'm quitting Wigu", then he's all like, "It's WIGU-TV", then "Ha!  Just screwin' wit'cha, it's Magical Adventures in Space", and now, "Actually, I decided I like the Tinkles better".  Jeffrey, I love your work, but can you <i>please</i> just make up your mind?</p>

<p>Hmm, that wasn't as bad as I expected.  But it's off me now.</p>

<p>Okay, so back to w0rkz0rz.  I'm really excited about this one I'm working on now.  It's slated for the first week of June, so look then.  Also, a good 'un is coming the week before that.</p>

<p>Oh, and <a href="http://www.questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=344">Friday's QC</a> was awesome.</p>

<!--Okay, what's going on here is that I want to have a row of nav buttons
between my comic and comments.  However, based on what I can find in the 
Keenspace Gear thing, there really isn't a way to separate these things.
Luckily, comments support HTML.  Hopefully, they'll support keentags, too.
I bet you they do.  So the second row's going in there, too.  Ha!
