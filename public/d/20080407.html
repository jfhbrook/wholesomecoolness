<br><u><i>Monday, April 7, 2008: BONUS COMIC</i></u><br>

</center>
<!--Now for some comments.-->

<p><em>This commentary was written in December 2024.</em></p>

<p>This comic was <strong>NOT</strong> in the original run of Wholesome Coolness. Instead, I posted it on my Flickr a few years later. <a href="/">Check out the foreword</a> for more context, or <a href="/d/20080224.html">the previous post</a>.</p>

<p>I drew this comic when I was in a 400/600 level math class on optimization, one of my all-time favorite college classes with one of my favorite professors. I don't remember where the idea for this joke came from, but Mercutio is modeled after that professor. I actually slipped the original copy into a homework assignment, and he returned it with no comment. In retrospect, I think he was probably trying to maintain boundaries with his students - but who knows?</p>

<p> Personally, I feel like the pacing in this one is incredible. Page 2 actually feels like the CSI: Miami intro to me. In general, that was always something I was pretty good at, even if coming up with a punchline was challenging.<p>

<!--Okay, what's going on here is that I want to have a row of nav buttons
between my comic and comments.  However, based on what I can find in the 
Keenspace Gear thing, there really isn't a way to separate these things.
Luckily, comments support HTML.  Hopefully, they'll support keentags, too.
I bet you they do.  So the second row's going in there, too.  Ha!
