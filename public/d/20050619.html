<!--Now for some comments.-->

<p>We got our power the day after I went to Chris's.  So that's cool now.</p>

<p>I'm using Ubuntu linux now.  I tried Debian, but...well, I'm a wimp.  I couldn't handle having to use the terminal to make my video output more than 800*600.  Yuck... I hate 800*600.  Anyhow, Ubuntu's pretty nice I think.</p>

<p>I'm still having issues getting all the comic inking stuff moved over to Linux.  I haven't been able to get Photoshop 6.0 running with Wine, and the wacom driver is iffy at best.  I might still have to draw comics in Windows.  Bummer.  Oh well.  Windows isn't THAT bad, I just don't like logging out then back IN.</p>

<p>Next Friday I'm out of here.  I'm going to Las Vegas for a while, then to that big ol' science camp thing I've mentioned before.  I'll be gone until late July. Updates should still happen though, so don't worry.  The commentary, though... it will probably mostly be filler.</p>

<p>I had a LAN party Wednesday night.  That was pretty cool, except that less than half the kids that were originally going to come could, and we could only get Counter-Strike running on 2 computers (1 v 1 CS sucks).  Still, it was pretty fun.  I want to do another one when I get back.</p>

<p>Ugh, I'm feeling... I dunno.  I tried drawing a new comic last night, and I couldn't think of anything.  Hopefully I will soon.  Of course, if I don't it won't be until next fall that it begins to effect updates.  I've got months of old material to run.  I'm just being a Fred Gallagher, that's all. :)</p>

<p>Hmm, the comic... I've said pretty little about this story, haven't I?  My biggest aim in this one was to get a cool layout.  Strangely, though, I think I didn't do so good there and actually succeeded more in colors (which is even more so because I hated the colors of this one when I drew it).</p>

<p>As far as characters, I tried to stick to obvious Trek stereotypes.  I'm sure you can spot them.</p>

<p>In the next few days I plan on processing about a dozen comics for your viewing pleasure, so things should be updating smoothly at least until fall. :)</p>

<p>I wrote this commentary over two separate days.  Can you tell the difference?  I wonder if you can.</p>

<p>woo.</p>

<!--Okay, what's going on here is that I want to have a row of nav buttons
between my comic and comments.  However, based on what I can find in the 
Keenspace Gear thing, there really isn't a way to separate these things.
Luckily, comments support HTML.  Hopefully, they'll support keentags, too.
I bet you they do.  So the second row's going in there, too.  Ha!
