<!--Now for some comments.-->

<p>So... our inverter is out. Fried. DEAD.  That means that my house does not have power until somebody fixes it. I am at Chris's house right now.  What a nice guy he is, letting me use his internet and his computer at his house.  Yeah, it sucks.  Big time.</p>

<p>But, as I said, here's an oldie.  I'm sure you can see I've improved a little, in a lot of ways.  Yeah.  You'll definitely be seeing this in the rest of the story.</p>

<p>Speaking of, this is the first multi-page story I've posted here, if I remember right.  I hope you enjoy, but if you don't... then I have another story coming that's 3 times as long!  It took me, like, a month to finish at least.  Probably more.</p>

<p>I might not get a chance to update, though, if I don't get power soon (because I'll be gone from June 24 until late July.  If that happens... then wait 'till August.  It would suck majorly, but I think you can deal.  Plus, it's mostly family reading right now anyway I'm sure.  Otherwise, hopefully no changes.</p>

<p>Well, I don't want to keep Chris waiting forever.  Be back sometime. :D</p>

<!--Okay, what's going on here is that I want to have a row of nav buttons
between my comic and comments.  However, based on what I can find in the 
Keenspace Gear thing, there really isn't a way to separate these things.
Luckily, comments support HTML.  Hopefully, they'll support keentags, too.
I bet you they do.  So the second row's going in there, too.  Ha!
