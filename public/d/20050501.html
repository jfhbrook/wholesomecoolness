<br><u><i>Sunday , May 1 , 2005: It is vitally important that you note the name of this drink--"Princeton Blast"...</i></u><br>
</center>
<!--Now for some comments.-->

<p>Senioritis is really getting to me.  I've been kinda irritable in school recently.  Sorry to everybody that's had to deal with that (unless they deserved it).</p>

<p>Which brings me to my class advisor.  The other day we had another class meeting, and <i>apparently</i> el presidente spoke ill of me after I voiced heavy disagreement towards (and I still think my thoughts were valid, but I don't want to go there), because he accused me of being a troublemaker/whiner and told me that I could either a) Fix it by myself; b) shut the crap up; or c) leave.  Nothing came up because Heidi, the girl mostly in charge of getting everything arranged for this trip is really good about this sort of thing (I almost said "a sweetheart"--can you believe?) and my particular issue had already been addressed.  So he deserves some irritation.  But not too much because nothing really came of it.  But definitely some.</p>

<p>I drew this comic ages ago originally--I believe I did so waay back in December, or maybe January.  Okay fine, in February according to my dating.  Anyhow, it had some color issues.  I fixed those somewhat based on suggestions from my mentor. That halo?  That's totally his idea.  It doesn't look quite awesome, but I suppose it's better than a lens flare or some other crap like that.</p>

<p>I think that if people don't look at the name on the bottle that they may miss the fact that it's named "Princeton Blast".  It's a drink that contains essence of <i>good</i> college.</p>

<p>I don't actually dislike "good" colleges or anything, don't get me wrong.  They're just not <i>for</i> me, that's all.  Or, that's at least how I feel.  Some of you may not know, but I got SAT scores that were good enough that I <i>probably</i> could have gotten into some kind of good college. Or, at least that's what they say.  I think that my SAT score (1420 was my highest) would have probably gotten me merely wait-listed at the best places.  I'm not bothered, though.  I voluntarily chose my local institution over UW, supposedly very good for a public institution, because UAF is so CHEAP comparatively.  Costs there all-told (including living expenses) come out for me at around 13 grand, 3000 of those of which are paid for through the UA Scholars deal off the top.  Meanwhile, IIRC, UW <i>tuition</i> alone for me was 17 grand.  Anyhow.</p>

<p>Mom told me she'll get me a new HD post-graduation.  I can't wait.  God I want Gnome.  It's so nice-looking.  I don't want to be screwing with my computer though until I have my stuff backed up onto another HD.  Man!</p>

<p>Anything else?  Umm... maybe.  I finished up the NHS application rewrite, so we have a better one at our school now.  This is good.  I may not have accomplished much as president, but what I DID accomplish was worth it (this and going on a field trip).</p>

<p>Now I think that's it.  Yeah.</p>

<!--Okay, what's going on here is that I want to have a row of nav buttons
between my comic and comments.  However, based on what I can find in the 
Keenspace Gear thing, there really isn't a way to separate these things.
Luckily, comments support HTML.  Hopefully, they'll support keentags, too.
I bet you they do.  So the second row's going in there, too.  Ha!
