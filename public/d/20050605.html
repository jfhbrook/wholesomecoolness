<!--Should give the date I posted this.  I love being lazy.-->
<br><u><i>Sunday , June 5 , 2005:  The After<s>party</s>rest</i></u><br>
</center>
<!--Now for some comments.-->

<p>I wrote up this entire thing about graduation, and when I was almost done... BEEP!  We lost power.  So I'm retyping this whole thing.  Oh, well.</p>

<p>My valedictorian speech... didn't get changed.  People seemed to really like it too, which surprised me.</p>

<p>I gave more hugs than I ever have before.  I received even more than that, because I was too tired to give them back (except for a few exceptions, where I was able to muster the strength).  I even received hugs from people I barely knew.  By the time I saw Dylan (one of my best friends and practically a brother to me) after everything was over, I told him, "I've given, like, 80 billion hugs".</p>

<p>He practically tackled me and said, "80 billion and one!".  (I love you too man.)  I gave 80 billion three hugs before I went to bed I believe, those ast two being Ayla, who's going to <a href="http://www.mesastate.edu/">Mesa State </a>, and the other to my father.</p>

<p>I learned something from giving all those hugs.  Skinny people are harder to hug than regular and overweight people.  They're bonier so their shoulder-related bones sometimes get in the way somehow, and in the worst cases I feel like I'm gonna hurt something if I hug too hard.  I also learned more about the weights of people I knew.  My grandfather, for example, has a slight belly now. :D  And Ivy... Ivy's really thin.  This surprised me.  I don't know why.  Her bones didn't get in the way or anything and I certainly didn't feel like I was gonna hug too hard--I was just able to wrap my arms around her further than I anticipated.</p>

<p>Last night I wrote that this made me want a girlfriend, sorta.  I think that might still be true.  In college, I'm sure.</p>

<p>I had to put together this slide show for my class, where it had pictures of everybody from little kids to now.  It took a lot of work to finally get everything together, but it was worth it.  The whole thing went quite smoothly.  It gave me warm feelings to see my hard work project flashed upon the wall in a huge manner.</p>

<p>Umm, maybe I should talk about the comic I drew?</p>

<p>First, if you have no clue about what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanservice">fanservice</a> is, then you'd be lost.  Really, it's the anime geeks I think that'd be the ones to recognize this quickest.  If that didn't help, maybe I failed?</p>

<p>The inspiration for this comic came from <a href="http://www.chugworth.com/">Chugworth Academy</a>.  Here's the deal with Chugworth Academy:  I really like T3h Dave's art.  He did this one fan art for Scott Ramsoomair for his birthday of a human version of Aeris (which I can't FIND!  Gahh!), and even though it wasn't finished at all--it was really just a colored sketch--I think I almost actually fell for human-Aeris.  He'that good.  He can write humor pretty well, too.  He is a funny guy.  The problem is that his comic is pretty fanservice-y.  It is quite obvious that his characters are supposed to be very sexy in all meanings of that term without breaking the boundaries of good taste--and he does this well--but it feels like he's using it as a crutch, like his art and good humor aren't enough alone to carry his comic, that he would only succeed if he tossed in the hot boobies.  That is why I don't read Chugworth.  But I still love human-Aeris.</p>

<p>Before I start talking about my own art, downloading my new wallpaper, featuring the hot sexy babe in the comic might help.  Remember, my screen res is 1600*1200, so that is what you get:</p>

<p><a href="/images/wallpaper_fanservice_large.jpg"><img src="/images/wallpaper_fanservice_thumb.jpg"></a></p>

<p>The three shots of the hot bikini babe (who most certainly has a real name because she's in the comic ALL THE TIME) were based off images I found on the internet.  I usually don't go searching for that sort of thing, so I had to ask for help.  How sad is that, a 17-year old not knowing how to search for porn/porn-related things?  (Because these were all in the range of tasteful I assure my readership.)  The last one I just drew without a reference, and I think that shows.  Oh well.</p>

<p>I did learn some things about unattainable anatomy though.  Check this out:  In the wallpaper shot, cover up everything from her breasts-up with your hand.  You should only be able to see her hips, abs and a little of her arm.  Isn't that weird?  This muscled vine-thing coming out of these huge hips?  But if you remove your hand, her backward-leaning spine and large-ish boobies help to balance the image.  This was really interesting to me.  I also found this sort of relationship with the heights of her torso (which might not hold true, I dunno), where the hips take up about 1/3, the abs about 1/3, and chest another 1/3 (approx.).  Helped me, sorta, but like I said it might not be right.  I also tried drawing clothes on her in my sketches, and that was a little strange.  Her t-shirt hung about 6 inches away from her spine.  Yeah, weird.  Anyway.</p>

<p>I'm not too sure about the colors on this one.  They bug me for some reason.  I think the colors on the wallpaper, however, came out great.</p>

<p>Now, fanservice isn't gonna be a regular thing here--sorry dudes.  Instead, I'm gonna run some stuff I drew before I started my Senior Seminar class, some of it from last summer even.  Next up comes "Kool Trek", and after that I might run my twelve-part "The Attack of the Planarian/Anteaters".  Could be a fun, if not sketchier summer (because I drew this stuff before I had a wacom tablet and before I felt comfortable deleting the whitespace.</p>

<p>I guess that's it.</p>

<!--Okay, what's going on here is that I want to have a row of nav buttons
between my comic and comments.  However, based on what I can find in the 
Keenspace Gear thing, there really isn't a way to separate these things.
Luckily, comments support HTML.  Hopefully, they'll support keentags, too.
I bet you they do.  So the second row's going in there, too.  Ha!
