<!--Should give the date I posted this.  I love being lazy.-->
<br><u><i>Sunday , May 15 , 2005:  Critically Acclaimed (Kinda Sorta but Not Really...At All)</i></u><br>
</center>
<!--Now for some comments.-->

<p>Oy...</p>

<p>So, senior skip day was Wednesday, the same day the bonus ran.  That was fun.  I didn't hang with the other seniors, and while I keep getting yelled at by my fellow classmates for it I do have a (kinda) good excuse.</p>

<p>So, about 20 minutes before I could have met up, I get a message from my Mom, who works at the school.  She said something along the lines of, "Hey Josh, it'd be nice to let your mom KNOW when it's senior skip day.  Thank you!" ~click~  It was funny enough that I spent the next half-hour figuring out how to record it to computer.  I really try not to host things here that aren't directly related, but for now you can download it <a href="/seniorskipday.wav">here</a>.  Once I start going to college I'll move it to the school servers.</p>

<p>Thursday was NHS inductions.  I had to get up at about 6:00 and pick up other NHS members so we could meet up at the <a href="http://www.talkeetnaroadhouse.com/">Talkeetna Roadhouse</a> for a breakfast to honor new inductees.  Then at the school we had the actual ceremony, followed by student government speeches for an election I could not vote in, being a senior.  I had a feeling the whole time that our advisor knew less about what was going on than we did, but I guess that all that ends well is... or something.</p>

<p>So this comic is, as blatantly scribbled on the cover, a remix.  I drew the original waay back in August, with a mouse.  So, here I totally redrew all the characters and some of the props--I think you can figure out what's new by looking for tablet-ish marks.  I also added that last line because when I showed it to my mentor (before he was my mentor) he said it lacked a solid ending.  I think really though that he just didn't get it.  And that's fair.  I'm making a five lightyear leap here.</p>

<p>So, to help, I will write a parallel story here.  A man comes to work in his new Hummer, and his coworkers are talking about him.  One says, "God, I can't believe that Bob's coming to work in a frickin' <i>hummer</i>."  His friend comments that he could have at least bought an H2.  Eventually, they get to the subject of their Subarus (and there is a conspiracy I am convinced where every teacher at my school if not every one in the world is required by the union to drive a Subaru hatchback).</p>

<p>Did that help?</p>

<p>So, that thing is up, the hit counter one.  It looks like I had seven people check in Tuesday for some reason, with maybe 16 people looking in overall so far, assuming nobody did multiple pageloads over the school computers.  Of course, I've only had it up since Tuesday, so who knows.  While I'm not expecting too much more in the way of pageviews, these data are pretty young, so I wouldn't put too much stock in the results yet.</p>

<p>Still, it's interesting to see where people came from.  Most people I'm pretty sure were just told about my site directly, but a few came from hackaday.com, where I sometimes post things, while others have come from the yahoo group for that science camp I'm going to--</p>

<p>which reminds me--I got a review of sorts.  Shakeel, a guy from the yahoo group, looked at my site, presumably when I had the url listed in my MSN name-thing.  Anyhow, he wrote that he thought it was pretty good, and that he wanted to try suicide soup (featured in last Saturday's comic).  So that's good.  Someone likes me. :)</p>

<p>Also, apparently Corgan Dane of <a href="http://grimtidings.keenspace.com">Many Tidings Grim</a> linked me.  I'm kinda surprised, because I haven't been really public with this thing at all.  Maybe he found it off <a href="http://guide.keenspace.com/">The Guide</a>, a place in which few mortal men are brave enough to venture?  Or maybe he reads hackaday?(!) I'll have him know I've been reading his work too at any rate, and it's a fun story.</p>

<p>Oh!  And I also made a pretty little wallpaper for all y'all, based on the iMac comic a while back.  Beware, it's huge, at 1600*1200:</p>

<p><a href="/images/wallpaper_ostrich_large.jpg"><img src="/images/wallpaper_ostrich_thumb.jpg"></a></p>


<p>And that's all I have.  I've made a few other wallpapers for future comics, those I'll post shortly.  Eventually, I'll have to make an entire download page. :D</p>

<!--Okay, what's going on here is that I want to have a row of nav buttons
between my comic and comments.  However, based on what I can find in the 
Keenspace Gear thing, there really isn't a way to separate these things.
Luckily, comments support HTML.  Hopefully, they'll support keentags, too.
I bet you they do.  So the second row's going in there, too.  Ha!
