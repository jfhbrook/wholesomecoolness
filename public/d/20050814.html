<br><u><i>Sunday , August 14 , 2005: Discouraging Reviews </i></u><br>

</center>
<!--Now for some comments.-->

<p>Hey all.  So I've been catching up on things around here.  Cleaned my room after a really long time.  Undid all Mom's well-meant "cleaning"  (i.e. shoving all my stuff in the closet haphazardly when it was organized and clean but <i>outside</i> the closet).  So that's done.  I also wrote some really late replies to some snail mail.  However, there is much that still needs to be done.</p>

<p>So, I submitted my comic to the Comic Genesis "Comic Pitching" forum.  Reception was less than stellar, but that's okay.  The advice I received has been really good, but, I mean, I'm sure most webcomic artists hope for an "OMFG I'm so bookmarking this!" or a weaker version of the same when they do that.  All I got was criticism.  I guess I need to work on anatomy some (I do know some of the proportion things, but I'm not an expert) and on having a freaking punch-line.  Yes, I know "Joshua Frigging Holbrook" didn't have a solid punch line ("your mom"?  What the crap?), and that I almost never have a "buh-duh-chee" moment.  Oh well.</p>

<p>For <i><b>completely unrelated reasons</b></i>, I'm thinking about ending the comic.  First, how I would do it:  I still have enough material around to last a few months I <i>think</i>, and I'd try to wrap up at least a <i>few</i> of my current projects.  Then, I'd just say "The End" and, well, not update anymore.  I'd leave it on Keenspace at least until I got some personal hosting I was willing to trust, and even then that might just be a mirror.  After this project, I might work on something else--who knows, a blog maybe (I've been spending more time on these commentaries anyway it feels like), or perhaps I'd experiment on podcasting (On what I have no clue).</p>

<p>So, why would I say such a thing if it isn't because of the above discouraging reviews (which, as I already said, were very valid and for that I'm greatful)?  Okay, so I'm gonna be moving to college in...oh... three weeks.  When I do that not only will I have a lot more work on my hands, but I'll also be out of both my scanner (er, <b>Mom's</b> scanner) and the digital camera.  Also, getting my Wacom tablet to work in Ubuntu Linux would involve <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com//WacomTabletIssue">fucking with the kernel (yes, I'm the Intuos 3)</a>, and that's just scary to me.  I may be using Linux, but that doesn't mean I'm some h4x0r or other.  I'm just cheap is all.  Plus, I <3 Gnome.  ANYhow, drawing the comic becomes significantly harder when I move to college.  Also, I find myself not being very interested in drawing it anymore.  Maybe it's like <a href="http://www.websnark.com/archives/2005/08/momentum_and_th.html">writing for Eric Burns</a>.</p>

<p>But what happens if the above paragraph is just me justifying myself and I really am just being a whiny bastard because my comic isn't the best in the world?  I worry about that.  So I'm gonna see how I feel in another week.  Hopefully by then I will draw my most current idea. :D</p>

<p>Maybe I should comment on this page, hmm?  Two drawings, both real easy.  I told yee that I was getting lazy around this time.</p>

<p>Well, that's it for today.  I'm gonna mess around in Linux some more... where I installed iPodder without using Synaptic (because Ubuntu doesn't have any podcast software)... oh yeah I am so proud of myself.  Of course, this is jack shit compared to what a lot of Linux users do, but I gotta start somewhere, right?</p>

<p>--Josh</p>

<!--Okay, what's going on here is that I want to have a row of nav buttons
between my comic and comments.  However, based on what I can find in the 
Keenspace Gear thing, there really isn't a way to separate these things.
Luckily, comments support HTML.  Hopefully, they'll support keentags, too.
I bet you they do.  So the second row's going in there, too.  Ha!
