<!--Should give the date I posted this.  I love being lazy.-->
<br><u><i>Sunday , July 17 , 2005: Hello, you've reached Josh Holbrook at 733-1337, he's not here right now but if you would like to leave him a message feel free to do so after the beep.  BEEP!</i></u><br>

<!--Now for some comments.-->

<p>Still at camp.</p>

<p>That text up top is tough to read.  I'm sorry.  I originally meant this to be in print, not on the intarwebs.  Also... I don't know what I was thinking.  Just... sorry.</p>

<p>Something else I was thinking at the time was that I shouldn't pencil before I inked--that way I'd get it done faster and not worry so much about screwing things up.  Through this story you can see where I started penciling and where I changed pens.  (I wish I still had those pens--those were nice, man.)</p>

<p>Like the Kool Trek story, this one has pacing problems I think.  Sorry's.</p>

<p>Did you know I actually drew this nearly a year ago?  It's true.  Look how much I've (not) grown!</p>

<p>--Josh</p>

<!--Okay, what's going on here is that I want to have a row of nav buttons
between my comic and comments.  However, based on what I can find in the 
Keenspace Gear thing, there really isn't a way to separate these things.
Luckily, comments support HTML.  Hopefully, they'll support keentags, too.
I bet you they do.  So the second row's going in there, too.  Ha!
