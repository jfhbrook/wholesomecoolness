<br><u><i>Wednesday , December 25, 2024: MERRY CHRISTMAS! </i></u><br>

</center>

<p>Wow! What a blast from the past, right?</p>

<p>Like the comic says: I was going through old CD-R backups from my childhood, and I found my old webcomics - and decided to re-host them! But I was never really satisfied with <a href="/d/20051120.html">how it ended</a>. For someone who was so goofy and optimistic, the last comic was just so bitter in comparison. While that was definitely a reflection of how I felt at the time... I didn't want it to be the first thing people saw. So, I whipped up a new comic - a foreword, if you will. A warm welcome.</p>

<p>On that note: welcome! If you'd like to read this webcomic and experience this time capsule, I'd suggest <a href="http://localhost:8000/d/20050209.html">starting at the beginning</a>. It's short. Don't expect life-changing art nor great punchlines - I was autistic, after all - but it has its moments. It can be amusing.

<p>Retrospecting on the comic is... interesting. In addition to posting comics, I also added "commentary", <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yujF8AumiQo">which was the style at the time</a>. While I was simply performing "aughts webcomic artist" back then, they offer a lot of insight into what I was thinking. I can see myself going from excited <a href="/d/20050209.html">in the first comic</a>, to <a href="/d/20050814.html">getting really discouraged by feedback</a>, to, well, throwing in the towel with a huff. Like I mentioned, I was starting to get hammered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder">bipolar depression</a> around then. But that all happened within the context of my life, too.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.comicgenesis.com/">Comic Genesis</a> community really did contain multitudes. On one hand, people were really tight, often kind, and very queer friendly. At a time when being gay or trans was a lot spicier than it is today (this was the Bush years), and where I was in serious danger of being sucked into a prototypical alt-right pipeline, their strong culture of inclusivity were a really good influence on me. Among other things, the chat is where I met trans people for the first time - Erin and Sareya - who were <i>so</i> patient with me and all my questions. Those experiences really set the tone for my attitudes and relationships with LGBT folks - for that, I'm grateful.</p>

<p>But there was also, sadly, a culture of toxic criticism. Critique is important as a serious artist - feedback helps you grow. But people would often tear into each other, even when their own art was just as flawed, and even when people were engaging more casually. In retrospect, that culture is a lot of why I stopped making comics, <a href="/d/20050828.html">whether I wanted to admit it or not</a>.</p>

<p>I don't necessarily regret moving away from comics art. I have new interests now that are similarly fulfilling. I also discovered while making this that my hands aren't as strong or steady as they used to be. But I do miss the elements of straightforward creativity that come with comics art. You do get to be creative in software - <a href="https://www.neversaw.us/2022/01/30/the-canvas-cares-not/">programming is art, after all</a> - but it's not quite the same, if only because I tend to approach software as a craftsman.</p>

<p>I will say, though, that I was surprised to find I still have a lot of those skills. Apparently, drawing is like riding a bike. Making this comic was overall a fun and positive experience, and I feel I've grown in terms of patience and constructing narratives. But I don't think I'll be getting back into the habit. These days, I'm addicted to engagement, and it's a lot easier to get that through <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jfhbrook">TikTok</a> than it is through a webcomic.</p>

<p>Still, this was fun, and I'm happy that my rage-posting will no longer be the first thing people see. I hope you, dear reader, feel welcomed.</p>

<!--Okay, what's going on here is that I want to have a row of nav buttons
between my comic and comments.  However, based on what I can find in the 
Keenspace Gear thing, there really isn't a way to separate these things.
Luckily, comments support HTML.  Hopefully, they'll support keentags, too.
I bet you they do.  So the second row's going in there, too.  Ha!
