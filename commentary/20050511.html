<p>Yay!  A BONUS COMIC!  I bet you're happy!</p>

<p>As you can see, I've had dancing on the brain.  I joked about this to someone I think, or about dance psychology or something.</p>

<p>For the record, I don't dance.  As <a href="http://maddox.xmission.com/26_things.html">Maddox</a> said, "Let's face it: there are few things in this world more stupid than dancing. Except break dancing, which pirates and lumber jacks would agree is awesome.".  Sorry ladies, but even <i>I</i> am not perfect.</p>

<p>Okay, so in this one I kinda did the drawing half-assed.  It's because of the crowds.  I <!-- Bad tag: HATE --> drawing crowds.  All the people are different, but the individual doesn't matter.  I don't want to draw someone that doesn't matter, but I also don't want my crowd to look like I pasted a piece of clip-art over itself a hundred times (which some of my work DOES look like, in the case of animal stampedes, but I figure that's okay).  Anyhow, so I just flat-blacked 'em.  Bah, I'm cheap.  So, two in a row of using iffy drawing skillz, once being waay inside-jokey, and once now going waay over people's heads with something mocking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis">mitosis</a>.  Does the god damned mediocrity END??  Soon, I hope.  Soon.</p>

<p>Okay, end mini-rant (done at the same time as my last real blog entry about), real deal comes Sunday.</p>
