<p>Yeah, this is bullshit.  Told ja so.</p>

<p>Near the end, I got into this nasty habit, I think, of not knowing what story I wanted to tell exactly.  If I ever get into webcomicry again (possible), I think I'd like to have my stories completely scripted out beforehand.  I think I would devote less time to coloring and being goofy and spend more time making characters with realistic (somewhat) proportions and putting them in complete storylines.</p>

<p>There is something that I like about drawing stories.  Once I know what's gonna happen I can spend some time drawing instead of having to think of a joke to tell (which is <i>hard</i> ~whine~). A problem I have, however is that in just about every instance I got bored with drawing the same story part-way through.  It helped in the next story (not Kool Trek II) to do just line art...but still!</p>

<p>Maybe I'd do more work on paper.  I do like paper for things.  It's much better for keeping a sense of size in my work, how layout fits together, that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Enough of that for now.</p>
