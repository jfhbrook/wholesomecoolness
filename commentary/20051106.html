<p>I liked how this story was turning out.  I was making these pages at a lot less than one a week though.  In these I electronically inked pencil drawings.  It seemed to work really well for me.  I would have probably finished this story eventually except for the fact that I left the scanner at home.</p>

<p>Next week I'll tell you what would have happened in the story--the short version (partially because I might eventually write it up as a short story and partially because I haven't worked out the details yet.  I'll also type about the origins of the story idea.</p>
