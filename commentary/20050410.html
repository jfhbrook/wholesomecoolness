<p>As you may have gathered from the last rant, I'm writing this one a week early, because by this time I <i>just</i> got back from Washington, DC.  I'll write on that later, and will probably post that 'un next week.</p>

<p>This is the very last <i>good</i> comic (one I like) that I have in my buffer.  Unless I finish one of the stories I'm working on, things aren't looking good.  I have an EHM one I'm doing in a purposefully crummy manner that I did two pages of so far... maybe I'll get off my butt and finish that one and post them at once.  I also have some others that are only marginally good... &lt;shrug&gt;.</p>

<p>Tyler actually did this.  This is pretty much verbatim.  Seriously.</p>

<p>If memory serves me this is the first work I've posted that has hand-inked line art.  I like the look, it's in some ways a lot cleaner than my electronically-drawn stuff.  I should do it this way more often... but I don't.</p>

<p>I think I'll rant about a question that will VERY likely make it into my FAQs if I ever compile one.  Well, not really a question, but more of a statement, or a request: Variations of "Dude!  You should make a <i>comic</i> about that!!".  I **HATE** this question.  I only like to draw comics about things I want to draw them about, and I hate requests.  I feel bad, though, because the question's usually pretty innocent.  Still, for those that read, <i>please</i> don't suggest comic ideas.  I don't mind, of course, a "Hey, this is funny, I thought you might get a kick out of this", but please no "OMG!!!  You should draw a <b>COMIC</b> about this LOLOMG!!!1".</p>

<p>You get the idea.</p>

<p>Laterz,</p>
