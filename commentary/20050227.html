<p>As you can see, both my pretty site and the second comic are up.  This is almost as big a deal as the first one.  See, I had to send in the first one as a sample of my work, to prove that I wasn't some flake, and that I actually had a plan of some sort.  Then, I had to wait a week to get the space, and then I gave myself two more to get my shit together.  So, even though this is the second comic to go up, it is the first I've posted myself.  So yeah, a big deal.</p>

<p>I think the whole site is together now.  There might still be a few bugs, though.  So, if you see any, you can email me (at dangerousdude_buttman@yahoo.com at the moment, if the email link's somehow broken :D).  For now, I'm going to only have a few links there, but I might add more later.  Something suggested by some people at the school has been to set up a forum so people can comment on my work, but forums have never really been my favorite.  Also, my friend Jake set up forums for a site of ours, and they were never used.  I really don't want that to happen here, so I don't want to do that until there's a good bit of demand.  Two other ideas have been a fan art section and a store link, but again I don't want to have those if there isn't a demand.</p>

<p>Oh, and I decided to save <a href="/oldeindex.html">the original page</a>, if you want to see.  The only thing I did to it was change the "todays_comic" Keenspace tag to a direct image of the first comic.  I think the rest of them should take care of themselves.  Pretty simple it was.</p>

<p>Even though this comic's one of my better ones so far, I drew it within a day easy.  I suppose that's fair, considering the amount of panel(s?).  I like the paradox (or "pair-a-box", as a teacher suggested)  the story involves, where by fixing the "problem" of only one panel the character makes it so that there never was only one panel, and...hmm.  Maybe he was mistaken.</p>

<p>I didn't have a set of characters in mind when I drew this, so I used random ones.  I think this is something I'll do a lot, at least in the short term.  I don't mind it, but I worry that this might not be good.  I guess my worry is that if I don't have a regular set of characters (no matter the story) that my comic would lack the premise needed to be considered one body.  But then again, Gary Larson never used the same characters at all, and he didn't really suffer. Still, someday I might make up a standard set of characters for these sorts of stories--I dunno.</p>

<p>As I've started this project, I've noticed that there seems to be a split of sorts in the comics world as far as philosophy.  On one hand, <a href="http://www.scottmccloud.com">Scott McCloud</a> said in <u>Understanding Comics</u> that he does not consider single-panel comics to actually be comics, as described in the above comic (note:  I don't see Scott McCloud as the definitive answer or God or anything of the sort, though I did enjoy his books and ideas).  On the other hand, I read in a book about guys that draw single-panel works for magazines (The New Yorker, Playboy, whoever) that seem to live by a reductive philosophy--that it's <i>best</i> to only have one panel, no words, and simple art--the idea being to get across the most idea/funny in the least amount of pen-strokes.  I've also seen this idea reflected in other areas, including <a href="http://www.pvponline.com/rants_howtobe.php3"> a rant by Scott Kurtz</a> (you'll have to dig a little).  This is obviously highly contrasting to the other Scott's views.  I'm not sure if anybody's right or wrong in this idea or anything.  I'm not even sure if it matters.  It's interesting, 's all.</p>

<p>I'm going to be out of town for a large amount of time this weekend (Academic Decathlon), so I'll likely be a few hours late next Sunday (posting in the moring, afternoon or even night instead of late Saturday night) because I'm updating this thing manually. Just so you know. &lt;thumbs up&gt;.</p>

<p>And... I suppose that's it, except to say that if you like this, tell your friends so I gain sudden and unexpected popularity and... I dunno.  I'm actually not aiming to be popular, and I don't expect to be.  Still, a readership of more than two (I'm being serious here) would be nice--it would make me very happy indeed.</p>
