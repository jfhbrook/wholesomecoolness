<p>Still at camp.</p>

<p>That text up top is tough to read.  I'm sorry.  I originally meant this to be in print, not on the intarwebs.  Also... I don't know what I was thinking.  Just... sorry.</p>

<p>Something else I was thinking at the time was that I shouldn't pencil before I inked--that way I'd get it done faster and not worry so much about screwing things up.  Through this story you can see where I started penciling and where I changed pens.  (I wish I still had those pens--those were nice, man.)</p>

<p>Like the Kool Trek story, this one has pacing problems I think.  Sorry's.</p>

<p>Did you know I actually drew this nearly a year ago?  It's true.  Look how much I've (not) grown!</p>

<p>--Josh</p>
