<p>This forms a sequel of sorts to the previous story I made about Mars.  At least, this was intended to have the same look, take place on the same planet and possibly share the same timeline.  It really doesn't matter.</p>

<p>But yeah, this is something I have talked about at great length with Tyler and Chris (who never did appear in the comic, sadly--he was a good buddy of mine).  We switched back and forth between moon colony and martian colony, and also between what sort of government structure we would have.  The point, of course, was to make our Martian utopia (naturally) a perfect society of sorts, where we didn't have to deal with the bullshit we get from big business, the RIAA/MPAA, the guv'mint, Saddam Fuckin' Hussein (Also called "Sodamned Insane" in some circles), poseurs, whatever.  Of course, the more constraints we put on our utopia, the more oppressive our regime became--and we are definitely freedom-loving folk here in, well, Alaska in general (though maybe not as much as New Hampshire--"Live free or DIE!!!1!").  Plus, Tyler is a friggin' libertarian (and I'm registered as one even though I'm definitely a moderate).  This became somewhat of a concern.</p>

<p>I think the best way to control this would be to limit who came in the first place.  Whoever came with us would have to fit our critera (basically, they'd have to be our close friends), but once we made it to Mars laws would be minimal.  Automatically, those people wouldn't do things we don't like, and by the time Martian society gets to the point where it's irrepairably corrupt Tyler, ChrisP and I would be long dead. "HA!  Fuck YOU Mars!"</p>
