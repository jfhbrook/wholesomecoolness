<p>If you haven't been keeping up with these...yeah.  It's ending.  I counted up (and processed most of) the comics I'll have to post.  I got three comics I drew earlier in the school year (Including a sequel of sorts to the Martian comic), a really shitty two-parter from last summer I'm just gonna post all at once, the majority of a Kool Trek sequel, and the first two pages of a more serious story.  Then I will end this son of a bitch.  It will most likely not live up at all to what I started with (which wasn't quite stellar to begin with), but I'm really okay with that.</p>

<p>When I am all done, I will leave everything on <s>Keenspace</s> Comic Genesis, so don't worry about that (Mom).  They will stay here at LEAST until I get my own reliable web hosting, unless somebody deletes them on the server end.</p>

<p>Before I go on, I want to reiterate that this has nothing to do with the less-than-stellar reviews I received on the forums.  I'm not being a mopey bastard.  The, er, "comic" above is quite accurate (speaking of, I've never seen anybody try to do an ascii comic really).</p>

<p>A few news items I guess:</p>

<p>1) My old high school... they found that the roof of the gym is structurally unsound and are going to close the school for the year.  Crazy, huh?  I'm typing this about a week before this gets posted, so by now I know more.  If you're reading this, I didn't bother to update the situation, and for that I apologize.  The three plans at this point are to a)Move the H.S. to a really tiny elementary school 15 miles North (Trapper Creek Elementary) and bus <i>those</i> kids 30 miles away to Talkeetna Elementary; 2) Bus the high school kids 50 miles South to Houston High School (<i>very</i> unlikely); or c) Keep the school open while keeping that <i>part</i> of the building closed off(some people would worry about their kids apparently, however).</p>

<p>2) Extreme Hammocking Magazine had its final hammocking party on August 25th, 2005 (today from when I wrote this).  The original four members of the magazine staff pulled a last few hammocking tricks and then went to Wasilla to blow some of their hard-earned cash ($60 each baby!).  I bought Doritos, a raspberry Arizona iced tea,  yellow silly string, a game of bowling, $0.25 on vending machine candy and a 10ft. ethernet cable, with $40 left. Boone bribed a pair of bowling shoes off the bowling alley, bought some CD's, some cheesecake from Carrs and maybe another pair of shoes. Jake bought a bunch of caffeinated things, as well as cheese dip and chips and WoW.  Dylan bought...condoms (with a funny "blurb" on the back) and a jacket I think.  Everybody that wasn't me also bought silly string and went bowling.</p>

<p>I think that's all going on here.  Sorry for closing up the comic so soon.  It sure is a good thing I hadn't built up a huge following. :D</p>
