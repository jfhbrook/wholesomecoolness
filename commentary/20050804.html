<p>Hmm... I still haven't fixed my banners yet.  That's next on my list... eventually I'll get around to it.</p>

<p>So, I did end up seeing Snow Nerds II.  It was really good.  In many ways it's a smoother product than the original.  At least, I thought so.  I can say better when I get my own copy.</p>

<p>I don't have much to say about this page.  Umm... just enjoy I guess.</p>

<p>Well, actually, I do.  A lot of the other pages do a sort of Queen of Wands-sort of thing, where the panels float over a background.  It isn't the same, of course (QoW had/s trails that connect the panels together), but... well, I hadn't seen QoW beforehand, and I didn't have a good excuse for doing this (she did it for more wordspace)--I just didn't plan layout very well.  Remember, I drew each panel as a separate picture and combined them at the end.</p>

<p>On this and many of the following pages, I did a better job.</p>

<p>So I've been working on another project recently.  A comics project, I mean.  It's another story.  I think I'll get this one out, though.  I'm not spending time coloring, so it isn't getting old like D-Dude did...and I think I have another story buried somewhere too.  Oh yeah... <i>that</i> story, the one of which I must never speak.  Oh, that's right, and Kool Trek II never really got finished either.  I really should finish that one up.</p>

<p>So here's something:  About two weeks ago I get this mysterious contact showing up in my MSN buddies list.  Nobody I talked to seemed to know who it was.  I suspected, however, that he (or she--I really didn't know) must have known me from somewhere.</p>

<p>Then last night, the following conversation occurred:</p>

<p>Strange, eh?  What an... interesting conversation... to say the least. :)</p>

<p>Umm... Oh, I looked again over the blogs of some of my fellow NYSCers.  Some I liked, some I didn't really.  It didn't really have much to do with who the person was.  It just depended on what they wrote about.  Jason, for example, just wrote about what had been going on with himself.  Most people did that.  <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/lawngreen">Ashley Jenkinson</a>, meanwhile, wrote stuff I didn't really get.  I guess I'm not deep enough.  I liked <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/topazandrose">Madalyn's.</a>  I'm not sure why.  Also, <a href="www.pcsucks.blogspot.com">Shaleen's</a> is kinda funny.  He hasn't updated recently, though.</p>

<p>Finally, <a href="http://www.starshiftcrisis.com">Starshift Crisis</a> is <i>really</i> <b>awesome</b> right now.  Go read it!</p>
