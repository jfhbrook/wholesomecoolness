<p>By this time I've been gone for over a week.  I think I'm at that camp now, even--not in Las Vegas.  I mean, screw that shit. :P</p>

<p>So, the story's done.  what did you think?  I was originally gonna use Soma by The Strokes for the song, but I think this ends up being a better fit.</p>

<p>Man, pacing's weird in this story.  If I did it again, page 2 would only be one page, and there'd be more transition before the alien shows up.</p>
