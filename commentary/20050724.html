<p>I bet I'm just having tons of fun at camp right now.</p>

<p>I used cut-and-paste a lot here.  I mean, drawing planarian/anteaters is hard work!</p>

<p>Yes, this has no roots in reality.  I know that. Well, maybe a few.  But no, I can't make planarian/anteaters.  That'd just be silly.</p>

<p>Man, I hope this isn't boring.  When I do stories I usually stop trying to be funny and just... tell a story.  But then I'm also not doing anything to bring you back.  There's no cliffhanger, no joke, nothing.  In a book these'd be fine, but... I'm releasing this one page at a time over a month and a half.  And one of the pages is a single frame!  I am worried.  Please stay... please?  If not come back later? :)  The story ends August 25th, and regular comics should resume on the 28th.  Hopefully I won't drop any updates this fall after moving to UAF.</p>
