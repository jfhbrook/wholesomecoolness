<p>Did you hear?  Keenspace is now officially called "Comic Genesis".  That's where "Comic Genesis" redirects to now, anyways.  Shoot, I'm gonna have to change everything!  I already changed pretty much all the web pages, but now I have to edit the banners too!  Oh well, it's better than "Toonspace".  Ick.</p>

<p><font color=red><b>THIS MEANS THE NEW URL FOR THIS COMIC IS http://wholesomecoolness.thisistheremix.dev/ !!!  UPDATE YOUR BOOKMARKS!!!</b></font></p>

<p>But yeah, I took the opportunity to change everything that was getting outdated, specifically the cast page.  It's about five times longer now. :)</p>

<p>Being back's been fun so far.  I hung out with a friend that coincidentally went to Europe the same time I went to Vegas/WV. He had some good stories, and I added mine.</p>

<p>Snow Nerds II comes out this weekend.  Snow Nerds was a snowboarding video some of my friends made... this is the sequel. I'm gonna try to see the premeire, but I don't know if I can.  We'll see.</p>

<p>Umm... so about this comic...OH!  So this is about where I switch from sketching to pencilling things in first.  About the same time I also switched to a slightly different pen.  Things look a lot cleaner about here (and better, I think). I worked on the grapes wench (sex slave?) for days to try to get her right, and it didn't work. I think I could do a little bit better now, but I don't really want to try at the moment.  Maybe <a href="/d/20050605.html">T3h Fanservice</a> is a good example?  Whatever.</p>

<p>Shit, I only have three weeks to come up with something new!  Oh well, I'm working on some stuff.  Not very hard, but some.</p>

<p>Umm, before I go, I think I'll point out <a href="http://forums.comicgenesis.com/viewtopic.php?t=65926&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0">M^2's thread</a> on the *ahem* Comic Genesis forums.  Yes, it is a thread of yummy.</p>
