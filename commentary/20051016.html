<p>I like the Josherprise in this one.</p>

<p>The captain was never drawn consistently.  I tried, but I think my problem was that I never really nailed down his design characteristics.  Therefore, he looks a good bit different every time I draw him.</p>

<p>Really, <i>all</i> the Kool Trek crew suffer the same fate.</p>
