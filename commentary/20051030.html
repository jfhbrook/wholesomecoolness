<p>As you can see, this page was never finished.  You can't see it, but I actually spent a good bit of time on the alien jammin' out in the background.  I drew it over a picture of my brother playing guitar for extra realness.  Sadly, the shoddy Kool Trek crew covers his fingers.</p>

<p>Happy Halloween, btw.  It's tomorrow, yes?</p>
