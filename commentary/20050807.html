<p>Last Thursday there were some issues with <s>Keenspace</s> Comic Genesis. The comic didn't update until Friday I think.  I'm not too worried/upset or anything, but I did have an update.  Go look if you missed it.</p>

<p>I've been pretty busy lately with things.  I agreed to draw a CD cover for my friend's band (There are two high-schooler rock bands in my town now--Dethroning Bucky and... Dissonance, I guess?  I'm drawing this CD cover for Dissonance).  Anyhow, it's a bit awkward at the moment I think, but it isn't looking quite horrible. I might post it up on the Comic Genesis forums, but... I'm scared.  I don't want to be called a bad artist, even if I am. :(</p>

<p>:P</p>

<p>The other project, I will present right now. Joel--the Joel featured in two of my comics so far (and I think I forgot to put him in the cast page--oh no!)----ANYHOW:  Okay, so Joel typed with me the other day via MSN in regards to <a href="/d/20050710.html">Mac'n</a> (Incidentally, that's one of the comics he was in):</p>

<p>Joel: that was the coolest comic i have ever seen<br>
Josh: Was it?<br>
Josh: That's good I think.<br>
Joel: yeah if only it was in 1024 768 form<br>
Josh: Why would it be?<br>
Josh: Why wallpaper form?<br>
Josh: so i could put it on my desktop</p>

<p>Yes, Joel wanted a wallpaper of Mac'n, and Joel wasn't the only one.  Oh, poor Macinley Holtan.  He gets so much crap from me.  But yeah, a wallpaper in giant-size!:</p>

<p>It sucks, honestly.  I was too lazy to clean up the line art so I colored over it, and that just made it look worse.  Sorry, dear readership.  Oh, well--Joel seemed to like it.  He wanted poor Mac to be more bloody though.</p>

<p>And we come back to the problem with that strip, or the general idea of needless violence.  On one hand, it's kinda mean to Macinley, who is in fact a real person and still a kid.  Mom thinks that if he saw the comic he'd cry.  I'm not so sure about this.  Still, I see where she comes from.  On the other hand, some people (Joel and maybe one other kid) thought that this was the best comic ever. ~sigh~ I just don't know.  For now, it's staying published because I think I've made it obvious that I did it in good fun...or something.</p>

<p>So how 'bout this comic, eh?  Umm... I put a lot of work into those three panels, I remember that.  Also, the planarians there are all cut and paste (obviously if you look close up).  I hope the effect worked.</p>

<p>Also, my brother commented to me Friday about how my art had noticably improved.  How kind of him!  Makes me feel all warm inside. :)  And I think it's true, to a degree.</p>

<p>Finally, the parents have been away the whole week.  It's pretty crazy!</p>
