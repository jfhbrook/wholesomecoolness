<p>Wow, time flies.  This update kinds snuck up on me.  Luckily I uploaded the actual comic that's about to run...oh, a month and a half ago.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I only have two weeks left to finish up some new, original content!  I had an idea just yesterday... but I've already forgotten sadly.  Soon hopefully I will remember.  In fact, I think I'll get to drawing arts right now!</p>

<p>While drawing this page and the next one, I started getting kinda lazy I'll admit--and I may have still been lazy for the one after too.  Luckily, I finished this thing off pretty smoothly.<p>

<p>Hey!  I remember what I was gonna draw now!  Good news, good news... I'm off to the doodlin' board!</p>

<p>--Josh</p>
