<p>Shit, I forgot to write this today!  Ahh, I remember when this was really important to me... it's strange how quickly I lose interest.</p>

<p>So, it turns out I <i>don't</i> have enough comics to keep this up for another six months.  I have one more 2-page story, the start of another longer story (2 pages at the moment), the beginning of a Kool Trek sequel (3.5 pages), and a few other loose ends.  I'll post them all, from best to worst.  Then I will end this thing.  Sound good?  Not really.  But it's what's gonna happen.  Sorry.  I've just lost interest big-time.  It's a good thing I don't have tons of readers to alienate. :D</p>

<p>I'm packing things up for college right now.  I need to find a bigger box for it all.</p>

<p>and finally, I'm sorry this panel sucks so bad.  It's the worst one, I think.</p>
