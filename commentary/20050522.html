<p>I started and finished this comic Friday night.  As one can see it is an obvious cut-and-paste job, but I felt that this comic lent itself well to that technique.  For the most part, we didn't move.  Yeah, there were little things, like the turning of a head or the hand-fidgeting, but...</p>

<p>Am I just justifying myself again?  I hope not.</p>

<p>Still, I needed something bad.  My good buffer's almost gone--I only have one more left.  Meanwhile, I have a few half-finished stories going on (so I haven't been slacking off really), and I've just been so busy recently that I haven't been able to get much done.  In any case, this is pretty well-written I think.  Damon lol'd.</p>

<p>So, people of internetland, meet Heidi.  Heidi's pretty cool.  She's also quite tall, as you can see (though I'm also short-ish).  Anyway, Heidi's one of my second-level friends I suppose--I don't hang with her all the time like I do Tyler or other people, but I do like her and we get along pretty well.  I think the main reason we aren't closer is because she's closer friends to other kids that I don't like as much (though they are kind people--just a bit goofy for my taste).  She's also in this pretty intense relationship with Vegard, a foreign exchange student from Norway.  Don't get me, Mother or either of their parents (this includes both Vegard's here-parents and his real parents in that one place over there). </p>

<p>I also made mention of Desere'e. I <i>THINK</i> that is how she spells her name.  She <i>is </i>pretty short (maybe 5 foot...1? I dunno.  I'll tell you if she says I got it wrong).  She is also quite beautiful.  And soft.  You may also remember that I had to dance with her at Prom because we were king and queen.  So, when Heidi (and I) said that, we were looking at a picture of us dancing (since removed I do believe).</p>

<p>What was almost better than this exchange (yes, from real life) was when I told Desi about it.  It's ridiculous how riled up she gets over jokes about her height.  She really shouldn't worry about it.  It's not like it makes people not like her or think she's hot or something (in fact, I bet some guys think smaller is sexier even, not that I would know what other dudes think--I don't really care).  Geez.</p>

<p>But yeah, long week.  I went on my senior trip Monday and Tuesday (a trip to Seward, taking the train from Anchorage), an awards ceremony Wednesday, and, finally, my senior project is wrapping up.</p>

<p>The awards ceremony--I'll admit I was disappointed. Since middle school, I figured I'd be the dude to get pretty much all the scholarships since I'm by far the smartest kid in my class and by far the one with the highest GPA.  I am also the kid with the most community service and the kid with the highest SAT scores.  Before you read the following you <i>HAVE</i> to understand what I was expecting, based on my years of hard work.  I had been looking forward to having most of my college expenses paid for--for the first year anyway.</p>

<p><b>Not so.</b>  I received the <a href="http://www.alaska.edu/scholars/">UA Scholars award</a> for my high GPA and a scholarship from British Petrolium in actual money awards.  I also got paper-only kudos for my community service (bah--I'm sure they'll look fine in my closet) and that science camp thing.  So I shouldn't get that upset.</p>

<p>But here's why I am.  In sheer number of actual scholarships, I came in a fairly distant fourth.  Cyrus Bee got most of them, with Desi getting a lot also and Heidi picking up a few more.  I'm not mad at <i>them</i> so much.  Okay, maybe I am. I won't go into that any further.</p>

<p>I try not to be bitter. I should have more character than this, and I don't want to take away from these people's good fortune. I also <i>like</i> these people, despite the impressions that I don't from this blog.  Still, it hurt pretty bad. Bad enough that I couldn't really get myself to do anything for the rest of the day. ~sigh~</p>

<p>[EDIT]I spelled Desi's name wrong in the comic according to my shiny new yearbook.  So I fixed it.  I got it right here though. :D[/EDIT]</p>
