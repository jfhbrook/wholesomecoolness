<p>Yup, I'm at camp right now, and I wasn't able to get FTP access there.  No up-to-date blog for you!</p>

<p>Little McKinley Holtan started his comic a few weeks ago.  He's featured in the June 15th Talkeetna Times.  I've gotten published there a few times, but didn't keep going because I felt I would prefer the freedom of doing web comics and having ME decide what to draw and not some editor over being paid ten dollars per comic.  In seriousness, it's probably good that this kid (who I don't really know, but I saw him once) is drawing stuff, and I wish him luck--and if he wants advice, I'd be glad to talk.  It could be fun.  No, I won't beat you up Mac.  I'm a good kid, I swear!  I was just kidding!</p>

<p>If anybody knows this dude, have him read this.</p>

<p>The only thing that irritates me is, again, the Times.  My comics were <i>better</i>.  I'm not being pompous.  And yet, when my comics were crammed into the corner of the classifieds and had to be about some current issue, this kid's stuff gets a third a page and an introductory article.  Those TGT editors wouldn't know talent if it bit them on the hind ends. &lt;pulls out baseball bat&gt;.

<p>Okay, next up is a huge 12-page story.  I'm running it two a week.  That's right--for, well, pretty much the rest of the summer, I'll be updating Sundays and Thursdays!  Woo!  (Otherwise, it'd be October before I got to post something current.)</p>

<p>Type to ya when I get back!</p>

<p>--Josh</p>
