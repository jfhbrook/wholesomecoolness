<p>And here we are with the first Thursday update.  I'm still gone FYI.</p>

<p>When I drew this, I felt really weird portraying myself dead.  Now, I don't care.  Also, look how my face has changed!  This is actually closer to the truth, I think, than the "me" face I draw now.  I've got the colors down now better, though.  My hair is a good bit darker than that.</p>
